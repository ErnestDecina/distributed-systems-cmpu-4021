You should create a .bat file (e.g. lab_env.bat) with the content analog to this:


rem Java 17
REM set PATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-1.17\bin;C:\Software\Python\Python312
set CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-1.17\bin
set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;.


To setup environment for Python. you will need to add the folder where Python is installed to the PATH variable
You can add to the PATH like this:
set PATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.17\bin;C:\Python\Python312\bin


or
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python

You need to find out exact path and Java version that is running on your machine and write it instead of 'jdk-1.17'.
The same for Python.

You can also setup the Environment Variables (on Windows11) using

System-> About->Advanced system settings->Environment Variables




For MAC users: you may need to use colon ‘:’ instead of  semicolon ‘;’
