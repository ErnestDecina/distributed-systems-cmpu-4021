Examples in Labs:

a) Examples in Labs are created and tested on Windows. To run it on MAC you will need to substitute semicolons ';' with colons':' for any directory path.




b) Setting up MAC JDK environment in terminal

1. Determine where java lives.

running 

$/usr/libexec/java_home 

might tell you. It may return /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/17.0.11.jdk/Contents/Home
On your machine it might be different.


2. If JAVA_HOME is found, then you could use:

export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
export CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib:.


Otherwise, once you know the path where JDK is installed, you'll have to hard wire, as follows:

export PATH=$PATH:/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/17.0.11.jdk/Contents/Home/bin
export CLASSPATH=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/17.0.11.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib:.


3. Put the commands from the part 2 into a file setup_java or setup_java.sh

Then, either:
3.1) 

 $chmod +x setup_java 
 
 and then run
 
 $./setup_java
 

or,
3.2)

 $source setup_java


To setup evironment for Python, you will need to add the the folder where Python is installed to the PATH variable
